# Android App Guide

This application has been converted to an Android app using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Android Studio**: Required to build and run the Android app.

## Project Structure

- `android/`: Contains the native Android project.
- `www/`: Contains the built web assets (generated by `npm run build`).
- `capacitor.config.json`: Capacitor configuration.

## Workflow

### 1. Make Changes
Edit your HTML/CSS/JS files in the root directory (or `js/`, `css/` folder) as usual.

### 2. Build Web Assets
After making changes, rebuild the `www` folder:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Sync with Android
Sync the changes to the Android project:
```bash
npx cap sync
```

### 4. Open in Android Studio
Open the project in Android Studio to run on a device or emulator:
```bash
npm run open:android
```
(This configured command automatically handles the Android Studio path)

From Android Studio, you can:
- **Run the app**: Click the "Run" button (green play icon).
- **Build APK**: Go to `Build` > `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` > `Build APK(s)`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Gradle Errors**: If you encounter Gradle errors in Android Studio, try doing a "File > Sync Project with Gradle Files".
- **Permissions**: If you need extra permissions, edit `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
