Part 1: The Scientific Foundation

The methodology is built upon the premise that "forgetting" is not a personal failure, but a biological inevitability known as the Forgetting Curve.

    The Problem (The Forgetting Curve): Discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus, this principle states that humans forget information rapidly after learning it. Without intervention, over 50% of information is lost within the first hour, and up to 90% can be lost within a month .

The Trap of Cramming: Repeating a page hundreds of times in a single session only stores it in Short-Term Memory. This memory is like a sieve; information leaks out quickly regardless of how many times you repeated it in that one sitting.

The Solution (Spaced Repetition): The antidote is Spaced Repetition (or Distributed Practice). Instead of mass repetition, you review the material at specific, calculated intervals. Each review "resets" the forgetting curve just as it is about to dip, forcing the brain to reconstruct the neural pathways.

The Analogy: The process is compared to building a brick wall. You cannot lay all the bricks in one day; you must lay a layer, let the mortar dry (time gap), and then build the next layer. This creates a solid structure (Long-Term Memory).

Part 2: The 7-Station Algorithm

To move a page of the Quran from fleeting memory to permanent retention, it must pass through 7 specific review stations over the course of roughly one month.

The Timeline for a Single Page:

    Station 1: The Implant (Day 0 - Morning)

        Action: Initial memorization of the new page.

Station 2: The Anchor (Day 0 - Evening)

    Action: Reviewing the same page before sleep. This prevents the initial steep drop in retention that occurs overnight.

Station 3: The 24-Hour Fix (Day 1)

    Action: Reviewing the page the very next day. This is critical as significant memory loss happens in the first 24 hours.

Station 4: The First Gap (Day 4)

    Action: Reviewing the page 3 days after the previous step.

Station 5: The Week Gap (Day 11)

    Action: Reviewing the page 1 week after the previous step.

Station 6: The Fortnight Gap (Day 25)

    Action: Reviewing the page 2 weeks after the previous step.

Station 7: The Monthly Seal (Day 55 approx)

    Action: Reviewing the page 1 month after the previous step.

Part 3: The Daily Workflow

On any given day, a user acts on three distinct categories of data to ensure the system works. The schedule is not just about moving forward; it is about maintaining the "rear guard."

Your Daily Tasks:

    New Memorization (Al-Hifz Al-Jadeed):

        Memorize the new content scheduled for today (e.g., Page 5).

Yesterday's Maintenance (Muraja'at Al-Ams):

    Review the page learned yesterday to secure it immediately (e.g., Page 4).

Spaced Review (Al-Muraja'ah Al-Mutaba'idah):

    Review older pages that have triggered their specific time intervals (e.g., A page learned 3 days ago, or a week ago).

Note: As time progresses, the "Spaced Review" bucket will contain multiple pages from different past dates (e.g., one from 3 days ago, one from a week ago, and one from two weeks ago all landing on the same day).
Part 4: Practical Implementation & Efficiency

    The "Vision" Review: The system asserts that while the schedule looks crowded as the month progresses, the effort decreases. By the time a page reaches the 5th or 6th review, the text is so familiar that the review is done by "sight" (Al-Nazar) and takes only minutes.

Flexibility: The table provided uses "One Page" as the unit and "December 1st" as the start date, but this is a variable. The user can swap "One Page" for "5 Verses" or "One Juz," provided they stick to the time intervals.
