## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

When you first open the application, you'll see the setup screen. Here's what you need to configure:

1. **Big Surahs Preset (Optional)**: Quick setup for memorizing large surahs
   - Select a surah from the dropdown (only surahs with more than 3 pages are shown)
   - Automatically fills: unit type (page), start page, total pages, and progression name
   - You can still modify these fields after selection

2. **Unit Type**: Choose how you want to track your memorization
   - **Page**: Track by page (most common)
   - **Ayah**: Track by verse
   - **Hizb**: Track by hizb (1/60th of Quran)
   - **Juz**: Track by juz (1/30th of Quran)

3. **Start Page Number** (only visible when "Page" is selected): Choose which page to start from
   - Default: Page 1
   - Range: 1-604 (total pages in the Quran)
   - Useful if you want to start from a specific page

4. **Total Units**: Enter how many units you plan to memorize
   - The label changes based on unit type: "Total Pages", "Total Verses", "Total Hizbs", or "Total Juzs"
   - Example: If memorizing 30 pages, enter `30`

5. **Start Date**: Select when you want to begin memorization
   - This determines when your first unit is scheduled
   - Each day after start date, one new unit is scheduled

6. **Progression Name**: Give your memorization plan a name
   - Example: "Juz 1", "Surah Al-Baqarah", "First 30 Pages"
   - This helps if you track multiple progressions
   - Automatically filled when using Big Surahs Preset

5. **Language**: Choose your preferred interface language
   - **EN**: English (left-to-right)
   - **AR**: Arabic (right-to-left)

6. **Theme**: Choose your preferred color scheme
   - **Light**: Light background, dark text
   - **Dark**: Dark background, light text

7. Click **"Start Memorization"** to begin

### After Setup

Once setup is complete, you'll see the **Today** view with your daily tasks. The app will automatically:
- Create items for all planned units
- Schedule reviews according to the 7-station algorithm
- Show today's tasks based on your start date

## Understanding the 7-Station Algorithm

The application uses a scientifically-backed spaced repetition system with 7 review stations. Understanding this will help you use the app effectively.

### The Stations

Each unit you memorize goes through 7 review stations over approximately 55 days:

1. **Station 1 (Morning)**: Day 0 - Initial memorization in the morning
2. **Station 2 (Evening)**: Day 0 - Same-day evening review
3. **Station 3 (24-Hour Review)**: Day 1 - Review the next day
4. **Station 4 (First Gap)**: Day 4 - Review 3 days after Station 3
5. **Station 5 (Week Gap)**: Day 11 - Review 1 week after Station 4
6. **Station 6 (Fortnight Gap)**: Day 25 - Review 2 weeks after Station 5
7. **Station 7 (Monthly Seal)**: Day 55 - Review 1 month after Station 6

### Why This Works

The algorithm is based on the **Forgetting Curve** principle:
- Without review, we forget information rapidly
- Each review "resets" the forgetting curve
- Spaced reviews move content from short-term to long-term memory
- By Station 7, the content is firmly in long-term memory

### Daily Workflow

On any given day, you'll have three types of tasks:

1. **New Memorization** (Priority 1 - Blue badge)
   - The new unit scheduled for today
   - Most important - do this first

2. **Yesterday's Review** (Priority 2 - Orange badge)
   - The unit you memorized yesterday
   - Critical for retention - do this second

3. **Spaced Review** (Priority 3 - Green badge)
   - Older units that need review based on their station schedule
   - Maintenance reviews - do these after new memorization

## Using the Today View

The Today view is your main workspace. It shows all tasks scheduled for the selected day.

### Task Cards

Each task is displayed as a card showing:
- **Content Reference**: The unit name (e.g., "Page 5")
- **Station Number**: Which review station this is
- **Priority Badge**: Visual indicator of task priority
- **Read Icon** (when online and unit type is "page"): Click to view the Quran text for that page
- **Checkbox**: Mark task as complete

### Completing Tasks

1. Click the checkbox on a task card to mark it complete
2. The card will show a checkmark and gray out
3. Click again to unmark if you made a mistake

### Reading Quran Text

When you're online and tracking by pages:
- Click the **book icon** on any task card to open a reading modal
- The modal displays the Quran text for that page
- Each verse (ayah) is shown separately with its number
- Text uses the Scheherazade New font for proper Arabic rendering
- The modal can be closed by clicking the close button or clicking outside

### Task Sorting

Tasks are automatically sorted:
- **Uncompleted tasks first** (by priority)
- **Completed tasks last** (by priority)
- Within each group, sorted by content reference

### Viewing Different Days

- **Today**: Shows current day's tasks
- **Calendar**: Tap the Calendar tab, then tap any date to view that day's tasks
- **Navigation**: The Today tab label changes to show the day name when viewing a past/future date

### Time-Based Filtering

For the current day (today):
- Morning tasks appear after your configured morning hour (default 6:00 AM)
- Evening tasks appear after morning hour (both shown together on first day)
- Other stations appear after morning hour

For past or future dates:
- All tasks are shown regardless of time

## Tracking Progress

### Progress View

The Progress view shows a timeline of all your memorization items.

### Timeline Items

Each item displays:
- **Content Reference**: The unit name
- **Current Station**: Which station you're currently on
- **Next Review Date**: When the next review is scheduled
- **Station Indicators**: Visual progress through all 7 stations

### Station Indicators

The 7 circles show your progress:
- **Completed** (filled): Station review completed
- **Current** (highlighted): Your current station
- **Upcoming** (outline): Future stations not yet reached

### Adding New Progressions

2. Fill in the form (same as initial setup):
   - **Big Surahs Preset**: Optional quick setup for large surahs
   - **Unit Type**: Choose page, verse, hizb, or juz
   - **Start Page**: Only visible for pages (optional)
   - **Total Units**: Number of units (label changes by type)
   - **Start Date**: When to begin
   - **Progression Name**: Name for this progression
3. The new progression will be added to your timeline

### Deleting Items

1. Long-press or right-click on a timeline item
2. Choose:
