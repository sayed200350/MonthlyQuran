# Monthly Quran

A simple, cross-platform application for tracking Quran memorization using a spaced repetition system. The app helps you follow a 7-station review schedule based on memory retention principles.

It is available as:
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** for any browser.
- **Chrome Extension** for desktop workflow.
- **Firefox Add-on** for privacy-focused browsing.
- **Android App** for mobile experience.

## What It Does

The application tracks your daily memorization tasks and automatically schedules reviews at specific intervals. Each unit you memorize goes through 7 review stations over approximately 55 days, helping move content from short-term to long-term memory.

## Architecture: "Write Once, Sync Everywhere"

This project uses a unified codebase located in `core/`.
- **`core/`**: Contains all logic (`js`), structure (`html` logic), styles (`css`), and assets.
- **`chrome/`, `firefox/`, `www/`**: Platform wrappers that receive code from `core/`.
- **`scripts/`**: Build and synchronization tooling.

For a detailed deep-dive on the architecture and how to replicate it, read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [agent/abstract.md](agent/abstract.md).

## Getting Started (Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- NPM
- (Optional) Android SDK for mobile builds

### One-Command Build
To build the project for **ALL** platforms at once:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will:
1. Sync the version numbers across all manifests and config files.
2. Sync the `core/` code to all platform directories.
3. Package the Chrome Extension (`build/chrome-x.x.x.zip`).
4. Package the Firefox Extension (`build/firefox-x.x.x.zip`).
5. Sync the Android Capacitor project and build the APK (`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`).

### Running the Android App
To launch the Android emulator without opening Android Studio:
```bash
npm run android:run
```
*Note: Ensure `ANDROID_HOME` is set in your environment or editing the script.*

## Algorithm Credits

This application implements the **7-Station Spaced Repetition Algorithm** for Quran memorization, developed by **Dr. Wafaa Orabi** (د. وفاء عرابي).

The algorithm is based on scientific principles of memory retention, specifically the **Forgetting Curve** discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus. Instead of mass repetition (cramming), the system uses spaced repetition at calculated intervals to move content from short-term to long-term memory through 7 review stations over approximately one month.

Each station represents a calculated timing for repetition to enhance permanent memorization: repeating the text several hours after the initial memorization, then reviews after days and weeks. This transfers information from short-term to long-term memory, utilizing the forgetting curve and effective repetitive learning techniques.
