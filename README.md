# Monthly Quran

A simple web application for tracking Quran memorization using a spaced repetition system. The app helps you follow a 7-station review schedule based on memory retention principles.

## What It Does

The application tracks your daily memorization tasks and automatically schedules reviews at specific intervals. Each unit you memorize goes through 7 review stations over approximately 55 days, helping move content from short-term to long-term memory.

## How It Works

### The Algorithm

The app implements a 7-station spaced repetition system:

1. **Station 1** (Day 0 Morning): Initial memorization
2. **Station 2** (Day 0 Evening): Same-day evening review
3. **Station 3** (Day 1): 24-hour review
4. **Station 4** (Day 4): First gap review
5. **Station 5** (Day 11): Week gap review
6. **Station 6** (Day 25): Fortnight gap review
7. **Station 7** (Day 55): Monthly review

This schedule is based on the forgetting curve principle - each review happens just before you're likely to forget, reinforcing the memory pathway.

### Daily Workflow

Each day, the app shows you three types of tasks:

- **New Memorization**: The new unit scheduled for today (Priority 1)
- **Yesterday's Review**: The unit you memorized yesterday (Priority 2)
- **Spaced Reviews**: Older units that need review based on their station schedule (Priority 3)

You mark tasks as complete by checking them off. The app tracks your progress and schedules future reviews automatically.

### Data Storage

All your data is stored locally in your browser using LocalStorage. Nothing is sent to any server. You can export your data as a JSON file for backup or to transfer between devices.

## Technology Stack

This is a vanilla JavaScript application with no frameworks or build tools:

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Styling with CSS Variables for theming
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks
- **LocalStorage API**: Client-side data persistence
- **Service Worker API**: Offline functionality and caching
- **Web App Manifest**: Progressive Web App support
- **Google Fonts**: IBM Plex Sans Arabic for Arabic text

### Browser APIs Used

- `localStorage` - Data persistence
- `serviceWorker` - Offline support
- `navigator.serviceWorker` - PWA functionality
- `window.matchMedia` - System theme detection
- `File API` - Data export/import
- `beforeinstallprompt` - PWA install prompts

### No Dependencies

The application uses zero external JavaScript libraries. Everything runs in the browser with standard web APIs.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser, or serve it using a local web server
2. Complete the initial setup:
   - **Optional**: Select a big surah from the preset dropdown (auto-fills fields)
   - Choose your unit type (page, verse, hizb, or juz)
   - **For pages**: Set start page number (default: 1)
   - Set total units to memorize (label changes by unit type)
   - Select a start date
   - Optionally name your progression
   - Choose language and theme preferences
3. Start using the app - tasks will appear automatically based on your schedule
4. **When online**: Click the book icon on page tasks to read the Quran text

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any static hosting service. For GitHub Pages:

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select the source branch and folder (root)
4. The app will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

**Important**: All file paths use relative paths (e.g., `./js/app.js`) to work correctly on GitHub Pages.
